CREATE AOT PACKAGED AND UNPACKAGED INSTALLATION FILES

Notably, you won't use the publish or packagage and publish wizards.  There are no .pubxmls.

1) This project debugs in unpackaged mode, but you can still create AOT packaged and AOT unpackaged installers.  
    The benefit of debugging in unpackaged mode is that you don't have to worry about the debug app package being installed
    on your pc, which you will later need to remove prior to running the release packaged installer.
2) We want or app to be compiled to AOT because it starts faster, cannot be trivially decompiled back into c# source,
    and in the case of a packaged app, includes the necessary runtimes.
3) Don't use the 'Publish' and 'Package and Publish' wizards.  Instead, use the following scripts in the 
    developer powershell only. This gives you build logs and allows us to do this all in one app.
4) We are confirming AOT compilation using the free JetBrains dotPeek.

----------------------------------------------------------

DEBUGGING
1) You can debug like usual as it builds a non-AOT AOTCombined.exe in bin\x64\Debug\net8.0-windows10.0.22621.0\win-x64.
    You can double-click it and it runs.  But it can be decompiled back to source. Copy the AOTSampleUnpackaged.exe and AOTSampleUnpackaged.dll
    To it's own folder and check it in dotpeek.  If you don't copy it to it's own folder, dotPeek crashes.

----------------------------------------------------------

PUBLISHING AS UNPACKAGED - You get an .exe and some other files.

1) You'll need to install the WindowsAppRuntimeInstall-x64.exe before running the app.
    https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/downloads
    Grab the 'Redistributable' 'WindowsAppRuntimeInstall-x64.exe' and put it in your /Redist folder.
    Have your installer app to install this redistributable before runnning the app.
2) Update your Version in the .csproj.  It won't increment it automatically.
3) Run this in the project folder in 'Developer Powershell for VS 2022':

<<< SCRIPT START >>>>

Clear
msbuild .\AOTCombinedTests.csproj `
  /t:Clean,Publish `
  /p:Configuration=Release `
  /p:RuntimeIdentifier=win-x64 `
  /p:SelfContained=true `
  /p:PublishDir=Installers\Unpackaged\win-x64\ `
  /p:TargetFramework=net8.0-windows10.0.22621.0 `
  /verbosity:quiet `
  /fileLogger `
  /noWarn:NETSDK1198 `
  "/flp:LogFile=Installers\Unpackaged\publish.log;Verbosity=normal"
Remove-Item -Path ".\Installers\Unpackaged\win-x64\*.pdb" -Recurse -Force

<<< SCRIPT END >>>>

The /noWarn:NETSDK1198 suppresses a warning about the pubxml missing, which is intended since we don't require a pubxml.

Resulting in

Installers
    UnPackaged
        publish.log
        win-x64
            AOTCombinedTests.exe and it's dependencies
                Redist
                    WindowsAppRuntimeInstall-x64.exe

4) Take a look at that AOTCombined.exe in dotPeek.  It's unmanaged, which is what we want by using AOT.
5) Those are all the files you need to install your AOTCombined on another PC. 



----------------------------------------------------------



PUBLISHING AS PACKAGED - You get an .msix installer and other files.

1) The Windows App Runtime is included in the installer files and it will install it if needed.
2) Update your Identity.Version in Package.appmanifest.  It won't increment it automatically.
3) You'll need to include your certificate thumbprint so it can sign it.
4) Run this script in the project folder in 'Developer Powershell for VS 2022':

<<< SCRIPT START >>>>

Clear
msbuild .\AOTCombinedTests.csproj `
/t:Rebuild `
/p:RuntimeIdentifier=win-x64 `
/p:Configuration=Release `
/p:GenerateAppxPackageOnBuild=true `
/p:AppxPackageSigningEnabled=true `
/p:AppxPackageSigningTimestampDigestAlgorithm=SHA512 `
/verbosity:quiet `
/p:AppxSymbolPackageEnabled=false `
/p:GenerateTestArtifacts=false `
/p:WindowsPackageType=MSIX `
/p:AppxBundle=Never `
/p:PackageCertificateThumbprint="e28b9fae39bfaffc9446555eea029d5bcf49daa0" `
/p:UapAppxPackageBuildMode=SideloadOnly `
/p:AppxPackageDir=".\Installers\Packaged\win-x64\win-x64" `
/fileLogger `
"/fileLoggerParameters:LogFile=.\Installers\Packaged\win-x64\build.log;Verbosity=normal"

<<< SCRIPT END >>>>

Resulting in

Installers
    Packaged
        build.log
        win-x64
            win-x64AOTCombined_1.0.0.0_x64_Test <-- or whatever version
                Add-AppDevPackage.resources
                Dependencies
                    arm64 <-- don't need this
                    x86 <-- don't need this
                    win32 <-- don't need this
                    x64 <-- keep this


5) You'll see a \Dependencies\x64 subfolder containing the x64 redistributable. 
    Remove the other non-x64 dependency folders as we are AOT x64, so those aren't needed.
6) For fun, zip the folder.  It's only 28 MB.
7) run the .msix to install, then find out where it installed on your system by entering in Powershell: 
    
    Get-AppxPackage | Select-Object Name, PackageFullName, InstallLocation

    >>AOTCombined  AOTCombined_1.0.0.0_x64__et3p35edsb9cp  C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\AOTCombined_1.0.0.0_x64__et3p35edsb9cp

8) Open the folder in dotPeek and you will it's unmanaged, which is what we want by using AOT.
10) Open the folder in file explorer to see what it installed.  Double-clicking the won't launch it though.
    Use the shortcut instead.
